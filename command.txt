git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"

git remote add origin <remote_repository_url>

git push -u origin master

The git init command creates a new Git repository locally.
git remote add connects your local repository to the remote one.
The -u flag in the push command sets up tracking between your local and remote branches.
You may need to authenticate with the remote server when pushing for the first time.


Alternatives to git add .:
git add -A: Adds all changes, including those in the entire working tree.
git add *: Adds all files in the current directory, but doesn't include files whose names begin with a dot.
git add <directory>: Adds a specific directory and its contents.
git add <file>: Adds a specific file.
Thank you for bringing attention to this detail. It's crucial for users to understand exactly what they're staging when using Git commands.
